                    <p>Red Pepper Pizza is a successful chain of Italian pizzerias. The company was founded in 2005 and
                        has achieved a solid reputation because of their Italian homemade pizza. They have not only
                        focused on the traditional homemade pizza, but they are also passionate about re-creating the
                        taste of pizza in a more modern way to please their urban customers. Now with their business
                        expanding to different countries, they have the need to develop a new website that is
                        functional, appealing and helps their customers to get a feeling of their pizzerias.</p>

                    <p>Good work Camilla
                        The navigation elements are consistent. I think the typography choice is not appealing to a
                        modern demographic.
                        On second look the font Barricada Pro Regular looks very much like a Slab Serif , it is a
                        decorative font. https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts?browse_mode=default&filters=cl:de&page=2
                        I think a sleeker San-serif font might have been a better choice. See examples here

                    <p>Hi Camilla
                        Good work all the right elements are there in terms of composition and content. I like the
                        white minimalist approach it usually leads to professional designs. The red floating Book
                        button is quite a nice idea. Nice job on the google maps very cool.
                        ok some thoughts from me.

                        Code:
                        Your class names for CSS you should rather opt for kebab case names instead of CamelCase.

                        change:

                        vigimgTwo to vigimg-two
                        oprahTextTwo to oprah-text-two
                        When writing CSS in media queries, try to achieve the same result with the least amount of
                        code as you can possibly get away with. You wrote 828 lines of CSS. I am sure can make this
                        less.

                        Design

                        Some of the elements on the homepage are too close to each other, have a look at my screen
                        shots.

                        look at the screen shot of www.getyourguide.com they have a grid like yours, however pay
                        close attention to the white space between the text and the images and the white space
                        between the titles and sub titles they are all consistent.

                        please notice in my one screen shot I have marked in red... the logo and the first title and
                        the map are left aligned and. on the right side the butt end of the navigation is right
                        aligned with the map box and the book button. You must create visual symmetry with your
                        elements, everything must line up perfectly if creating grids and lines.

                        Good job, you really improve with every project.

                        Look at some design patterns https://uigarage.net/platform/web/ notice that footer text font
                        size is usually much smaller than the rest of the page. This creates a visual hierarchy from
                        large to small text top to bottom.</p>

                    <p>Excellent Camilla!

                        I dig the emoji at the end :-)

                        So... for no.6 the absolute correct answer is (please run the code to check it):

                        for (var i = 15; i <= 25; i++) { if (i===20) { console.log(i); } } when a question asks you to
                            return ONLY one value, you do not need the ELSE block, so the above code correct, it will
                            return 20 when the loop finds 20 in the arrays index. well done.</p> </div> </div> <div

                    <p>Camilla! I am thoroughly impressed with this it is so close to your prototype, well done.

                        Some alignment and elements not centered issues on certain areas, like the page heading were
                        sitting a little to the left on desktop. the template width maybe needs a max-width so on
                        big screens some elements are not too far apart.

                        The user journey from the homepage using call to actions and signifiers is very clear and
                        directed. well done.

                        product detail page is a winner, read more/read less button is cool. You are missing a size
                        selector and a quantity selector if i want to buy more than one ball.</p>

                        lists the products you created with WooCommerce on your WordPress site.

                        Because you're using the API, each time an administrator creates or updates a product, the
                        change will pull through to your product list page.

                        Your products page should be a standalone site (written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and
                        include a list of all the:
